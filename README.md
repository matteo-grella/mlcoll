# MLColl (machine-learning-component-collection) 

MLColl is a reusable library that contains basic machine learning components implemented from scratch in Ada 2012 programming language.
It includes a simple feed-forward network with a final softmax prediction (MLP), a "vanilla" recurrent neural network (RNN) and a coarse version of the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

#### Required library

#### Special Notes

MLColl has been written for the purpose of study and exercise only, and it is not production-ready. Therefore it is not recommended to use it in professional applications where it is required numerical stability and optimized algorithms.

MLColl was tested only with the GNAT GPL 2016 compiler.

#### License

Distributed as source code, the ARColl files are licensed under the terms of the GNAT-Modified GPL, which means that the use of the ARColl does not result in software that is covered by the GNU General Public License.
